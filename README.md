# My Machine Learning Playground

---

This repository serves as a personal laboratory for exploring and implementing various **machine learning algorithms**. It showcases my understanding of core ML concepts through **from-scratch implementations** and demonstrates practical application using industry-standard libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.

---

## What's Inside?

* **From-Scratch Implementations:** Dive deep into the mechanics of algorithms like linear/logistic regression, neural networks. These implementations aim to demystify the underlying mathematics and logic.
* **Scikit-learn Examples:** Practical applications of scikit-learn for common ML tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* **TensorFlow Explorations:** Examples demonstrating the use of TensorFlow for building and training neural networks, from basic architectures to more complex models.
* **Few ML Models:** Implemented few ML models using datasets from Kaggle or Internet.

## Why This Repo?

This project is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and mastery in machine learning. It's a space where I:

* **Reinforce theoretical knowledge** through hands-on coding.
* **Compare and contrast** custom implementations with optimized library versions.
* **Experiment with different approaches** to problem-solving in ML.
